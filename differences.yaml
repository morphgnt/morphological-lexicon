    comment:
        - BDAG has breathing but no accent
        - Danker CL and Mounce have ἀββά
        - SBLGNT doesn't accent Αββα so it would be consistent for the lemma not to be accented either (although should it be capitalized?)

    comment:
        - interjection from present imperative of ἄγω

        tags: ["η/ομαι"]

    comment:
        - αἰσχύνη is a noun
        - αἰσχύνομαι is a verb (in Danker CL as αἰσχύνω)
        - lexemes.yaml is likely just wrong
αἴτιον:
    αἴτιος:
        tags: ["ον/ος"]
        sources: ["danker-entry", "mounce-headword", "bdag-headword"]
    comment:
        - Danker CL (and likely BDAG and Mounce) treat αἴτιος and αἴτιον as same lexeme
        - entry in Danker CL suggests a difference in meaning that should be reflected in our analysis
        - Danker CL suggests:
            - Lk 23:4 is neuter (we have neuter but αἴτιος)
            - Lk 23:22 is neuter? (we have neuter but αἴτιος)
            - Ac 19:40 is neuter (we have neuter and αἴτιον)
            - Hb 5:9 is masculine (we have masculine and αἴτιος)
        - Danker CL does not comment on Lk 23:14

    comment:
        - ἀκριβέστερον is the comparative of ἀκριβῶς and neither BDAG nor Danker CL treat it as a separate lexeme
        - our analysis is inconsistent in adverb vs adjective (treating ἀκριβέστερον as an adjective 3 times and adverb once)

        - Mounce has separate entries for ἀψίνθιον ἄψινθος but not for Ἄψινθος

        - our analysis has βάϊον but text suggests βαΐον may be better

    comment:
        - this is always and interesting case because there are two distinct lexemes, one of which has two genders
        - need to check printed BDAG as likely only missing in my electronic list of headwords because of I./II.
        - as well as checking BDAG, we need to decide how best to model these lexemes

    comment:
        - Danker CL identifies it as a neuter comparative functioning as adverb
        - Robinson analysis has ADV-C but CCAT analysis has A<ASNC>
        - BDAG, Danker CL and Mounce all prefer βελτίων
        - key question is: is this simply *functioning* as an adverb or do we say it *is* an adverb, derived from an adjective (latter is my leaning)

    comment:
        - ἐλαία = olive tree; hence τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἐλαιῶν = mount of olives
        - ἐλαιών (note accent) is an olive grove
        - BDAG, Mounce and Danker CL all have ἐλαιών and ἐλαία as separate entries
        - Danker CL includes the sense τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἐλαιῶν under ἐλαία, not ἐλαιών
        - I'll have to check BDAG to see where it puts the τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἐλαιῶν case
        - our normalized text has both ἐλαιῶν and Ἐλαιῶν which are lemmatized ἐλαία and Ἐλαιῶν respectively
        - we may need to review each on a case-by-case basis
        - this is related to how we handle oblique cases in multi-word proper nouns elsewhere
